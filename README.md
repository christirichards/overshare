# Overshare

Many social sharing libraries and plugins considerably increase the loading times of your site by including additional scripts, styles, tracking, analytics, and sharing counters.

Overshare is a lightweight solution with simplicity and speed in mind.  It was built to address many of issues that severely impacted website performance and page speed results.

Currently, Overshare includes over 45+ (and growing) social sharing sites and options for your oversharing pleasure.

### What Overshare does:

-   Overshare works without including any Javascript
-   Overshare works without impacting your site's performance

### What Overshare is NOT:

-   Overshare does NOT include fancy analytics, share counters, or a bloated options package.
